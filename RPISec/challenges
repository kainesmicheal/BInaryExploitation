the check funtion checks for the lenght of the string and adds every element
if the total is 15
we are in
pass:33333

crack00x05
the check function checks for the lenght of the string and adds every element
if the total is 16
we are in 
pass:4444

crack00x06
the sum of the entered numbers should be equal to 16
dummy function checks if there is the the string is equal to LOL
and the string is taken from environment variable

phase one: public speaking is easy!...is iin compared witho ur input
phase two: arr[a + 1] != (a + 1) * arr[a]
1 2 6 24 120 720
phase three: c=160 b=o a=4
phase four: the resurse should take 9 as input to return 55 which is checked
phase five: 
array   
0 = i 1 = s 2 = r 3 = v 4 = e 5 = a 6 = w 7 = h 
8 = o 9 = b 10 = p 11 = n 12 = u 13 = t 14 = f 15 = g

arr[x & 15]
we need 15  0   5   11  13  1
answer  111 112 117 123 125 113

phase six:
enter number are used to create a vlaue for node and the node are compared...
if the nodes are in higher to lower oder relative to the values in it
